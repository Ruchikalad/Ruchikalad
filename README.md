Car-Sales
This Python code analyzes car sales data using various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express. Let's break down what each section of the code does:

Data Loading and Initial Exploration:

Loads the car sales data from a CSV file named "Car Sales.xlsx - car_data (1).csv" into a Pandas DataFrame called df. Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame using df.head(). Checks the shape of the DataFrame using df.shape. Checks for missing values in the DataFrame using df.isna().sum(). Displays information about the DataFrame using df.info(). Provides descriptive statistics of the numeric columns using df.describe(). Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Renames certain columns of the DataFrame for better readability. Data Visualization:

Creates a line plot showing the trend of total car prices over time. Creates a count plot to visualize the distribution of car sales by gender. Creates a bar chart displaying the top 10 combinations of car companies and their total prices. Creates a bar chart showing the total prices of different car styles. Creates a grouped bar chart to compare car prices across different styles and companies. Creates a grouped bar chart to compare car prices across different transmissions and companies. Displays the top 5 dealers with the highest number of sales. Visualizes the distribution of car sales across dealer regions. Data Analysis:

Displays the count of different engine types in the dataset.
